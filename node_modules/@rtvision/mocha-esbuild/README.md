Run tests with mocha compiled by esbuild at lightning fast [speeds](https://esbuild.github.io/). 

CLI requires a .esbuildrc.js file with an annotated example [here](https://github.com/RtVision/mocha-esbuild/blob/master/.esbuildrc.js)
while its possible it would work only the defaults it really depends on your projects setup.

I personally made this CLI to compile vue SFC components that are then tested with mocha and have seen pretty big speed increases.
One in partically that stood out to me was webpack building a single test file and all its dependencies took 1 minute and 15s while
esbuild did it in about 15s. When developing tests this time saving really adds up!

If you need alias's to work like webpacks common @ resolving to ./src then you can add a tsconfig.json or a jsconfig.json file and add
the aliases like described [here](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/module-resolution.html#path-mapping). You can use
this even if you don't have any typescript in your project since esbuild will look at your config file regardless.

If you want to use sourcemaps, you will need to either start mocha-esbuild with the node --enable-source-maps flag i.e.
`node --enable-source-maps node_modules/@rtvision/bin/run -s --noImportSourceMapSupport` or do `npm install --save-dev source-map-support`.
[Until node allows scripts to determine](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/38817) whether or not sources maps should be on this is only solution I know of.
Note that this does introduce some big overhead for bigger files/projects, I myself notice several seconds of slowdown in startup time of the tests. I only enable it while developing tests or rerunning a failed test locally.
